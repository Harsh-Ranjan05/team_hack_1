❗ Problem Statement
Modern navigation systems like Google Maps primarily optimize routes based on shortest distance or fastest travel time. While efficient, they overlook several critical real-world factors that directly impact travelers’ safety, cost, and environmental exposure.

Urban commuters today face multiple challenges:

Increasing air pollution (AQI) affecting health

Lack of visibility into crime-prone or accident-prone areas

No transparent cost comparison across transport modes

No optimization for multi-modal transport (walking + bus/train)

Routes focused on speed rather than safety and sustainability

As a result, users cannot make fully informed travel decisions that balance time, cost, safety, and environmental impact.

There is a need for a smart routing system that integrates multi-modal transport planning, pollution awareness, risk detection, and cost optimization — all presented clearly through interactive map platforms like Google Maps and OpenStreetMap.
